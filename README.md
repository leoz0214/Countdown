# Countdown

Inspired by the British game show '*Countdown*', where one of the
aspects of the show is making a larger number out of smaller ones,
this is the focus of this game, also called '***Countdown***'.

The player has to find an expression equal to a carefully generated target number from selected numbers of their choice (or automatically generated).
However, they only have **30 seconds** to find a solution. The game really
is linked with the game show, but with some slight differences, such as having **7** selected numbers instead of 6.

## Why play?

Apart from enjoying the game show, here are some great reasons why should devote
some time to this game:
* You can develop your **mental maths skills** as you need to perform quick calculations
to develop a solution in time.
* There are **stats and achievements** to track your progress, which demonstrate your
experience and expertise.
* It is **fun**! Well, at least better than doing actual boring maths, of course!

## Installation

Currently, this game can only be run on Windows. There are two ways to add the
game to your computer and get started:

1. **Executable** - files have been bundled into one folder, and so, you can just
play the game without Python installed.
2. **Python** - if you have Python installed, which is at least version 3.10, you can
simply run the main module in the source code with all the required files alongside.
Please ensure you have the 3rd party libraries 'tendo' and 'pygame' installed,
and preferably 'ujson' for faster JSON parsing (optional). The main benefit of just running
the code directly from Python is that the game starts up faster.
If any of this is too complicated or infeasable, just use method 1.

For either method, please place the game folder in an
appropriate location on your computer of your choice. No matter where the game itself
is saved, your game data will be saved in your user data folder: AppData/Local
